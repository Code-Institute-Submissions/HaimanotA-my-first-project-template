    <h2>Quick Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>He is multilingual.</li>
        He’s always been interested in ancient languages such as Latin, and 
        he can speak Mandarin.
    
        <li>He looks up to Albert Einstein and Pablo Picasso.</li> 
        He has Einstein’s quote, "Make things as simple as possible but no simpler,” and Picasso’s insight that, "All children are artists. The problem is how to remain an artist once you grow up,” as his favorites on Facebook.
           
        <li>He turned down many offers to sell Facebook.</li>
        Many big name companies wanted to see if he wanted to sell NewsCorp, MySpace, Viacom, Yahoo, NBC, Microsoft (again) and Google all put their hats in the ring -- but Zuckerberg held firm.
